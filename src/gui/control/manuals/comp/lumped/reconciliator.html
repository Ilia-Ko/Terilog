<h1>Reconciliator</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: R</h2>
<p>
    If you've ever designed digital circuits with the use of MOSFETs, you must remember the pain brought to you by
    'hanging' (suspended) wires. When a wire has no voltage (ZZZ signal in Terilog), every MOSFET treats it the way
    its gate's charge wants!
</p>
<p>
    In real world you would probably pull that terrible 'hanging' wire to ground with 100k resistor. But there is no
    resistors in Terilog (because there is no currents too (and there is no currents, because Terilog uses MOSFETs
    instead of BJTs)). Here comes Reconciliator!
</p>
<p>
    Reconciliator has one input (source) and one output (drain) and is usually inserted in a wire. The colour of a
    reconciliator shows, to which logic level it is going to pull its drain if the source is suspended (ZZZ signal).

    Here is the complete table describing Reconciliator's behaviour:
