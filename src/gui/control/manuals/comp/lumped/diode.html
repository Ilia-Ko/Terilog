<h1>Diode</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: D</h2>
<p>
    Diode is a semiconductor component with two terminals: anode and cathode. Terilog uses "one-way conductor" ideal
    model of diode. It means that diode transfers positive voltage from anode to cathode (and transfers negative
    voltage from cathode to anode). Described behaviour is normal diode functioning in Terilog.

    But what if I apply POS to anode and NEG to cathode? As our diode is ideal conductor in this case, you simply
    get a short circuit which causes collapse of strong POS and NEG signals. As a result both anode and cathode will
    signalize about error in a circuit.
