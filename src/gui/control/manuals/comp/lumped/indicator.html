<h1>Indicator</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: I</h2>
<p>
    Indicator has only one input pin - source. Its role is pretty simple - to indicate the voltage on this pin. You can
    treat Indicator as ideal multicoloured LED lamp that requires no power to emit light. Therefore it has no power
    inputs, just logical signal source input pin. It can be used only as the nice evidence of the signal a wire has.
