<h1>Lumped components</h1>
<p>
    Almost all lumped components are essential for circuit design, even if they are not classified properly. Terilog
    offers Voltage (circuit inputs), Indicator (circuit outputs), Reconciliator and Diode. See underlying chapters for
    more information about them.
