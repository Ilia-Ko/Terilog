<h1>DC Voltage source</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: V</h2>
<p>
    DC (Direct Current) Voltage source is an ideal voltage source (with zero internal impedance). It has just one output -
    drain, which receives a signal from the Voltage. The role of Voltage is similar to entry point in a programme: the
    simulation starts with the Voltages transferring their signals to output wires (connected to their drains).
