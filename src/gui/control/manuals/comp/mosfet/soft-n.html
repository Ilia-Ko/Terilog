<h1>Soft N</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: Shift+N</h2>
<p>
    Soft N is n-channel MOSFET with V<sub>gs(th)</sub> = +1.5V. It means that it would open if V<sub>g</sub> - V<sub>s</sub>
    &gt;= +1.5V. And it would really do if it were totally ideal. But Terilog tries not to forget completely about
    unideal nature of components. That's why you should feel like Soft N 'does not like' positive source voltages: if
    source is positive and gate is stable - the drain will go positive (regardless to V<sub>g</sub>). Here is summarizing
    table of Soft N behaviour.
