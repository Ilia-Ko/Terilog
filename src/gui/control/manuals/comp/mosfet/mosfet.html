<h1>MOSFET</h1>
<p>
    MOSFET = Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor.
</p>
<p>
    MOSFETs are the most popular transistors nowadays. Of course, BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors) are not forgotten,
    but MOSFETs have some advantages (like lower power consumption) in logic-level circuitry applications.
</p>
<p>
    Terilog simulates a MOSFET like ideal voltage-controlled switch. It is closed when no zero voltage is applied to
    controlling terminals and suddenly opens when voltage between them reaches the threshold voltage (V<sub>gs(th)</sub>).
    Practice shows that this idealization of the transistor is enough for reliable circuit design. MOSFET has three
    terminals: source, gate and drain. First two are controlling terminals.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Source</b> is a pin that contacts with two legs of a MOSFET (because bulk is usually connected to source). It works
    like an input terminal. This means, that the voltage on the source (V<sub>s</sub>) always affects the MOSFET, whereas
    it cannot affect the wire connected to it.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Gate</b> is a pin that has no contact with legs (because it is usually isolated from conducting zones). It works
    like an input terminal too. The voltage on the gate (V<sub>g</sub>) is vital for MOSFET because its behaviour directly
    depends on the difference V<sub>gs</sub> = V<sub>g</sub> - V<sub>s</sub>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Drain</b> is a pin that contact with only one remaining leg of the MOSFET. It is an 'output' of a MOSFET - it
    does not affect the behaviour of the transistor, but always affects the wire connected to it. Terilog approximates
    the MOSFET like a function that takes V<sub>g</sub>, V<sub>s</sub> and computes drain voltage (V<sub>d</sub>).
</p>

    The underlying chapters about available MOSFETs (Hard N, Hard P, Soft N, Soft P) will briefly describe every transistor
    and (the last, but not the least!) will give tables defining their approximating functions.
