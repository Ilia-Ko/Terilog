<h1>Hard P</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: P</h2>
<p>
    Hard P is p-channel MOSFET with V<sub>gs(th)</sub> = -3.0V. It means that it would open if V<sub>g</sub> - V<sub>s</sub>
    &lt;= -3.0V. And it would really do if it were totally ideal. But Terilog tries not to forget completely about
    unideal nature of components. That's why you should feel like Hard P 'does not like' negative source voltages: if
    source is negative and gate is stable - the drain will go negative (regardless to V<sub>g</sub>). Here is summarizing
    table of Hard P behaviour.
