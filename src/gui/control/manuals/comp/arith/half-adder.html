<h1>Half Adder</h1>
<p>
    Half Adder is an arithmetic circuit with two inputs (trit A, trit B) and two outputs (their Sum and Carry propagation).
    As it follows from their names, Half Adder takes input trits A and B, adds them together and outputs their sum and
    the carry appeared during addition. In ternary logic it is possible to construct Half Adder with the use of 14 MOSFETs.
    Of course, we mean Half Adder with negated outputs. But there is no dramatic difference between normal and negated
    Half Adders, because both of them can be used to make Full Adder.

<p>Here is the complete truth table for normal Half Adder. Note that Terilog offers only negated Half Adder.</p>
