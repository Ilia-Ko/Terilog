<h1>Full Adder</h1>
<p>
    Full Adder is a circuit with three inputs (trits A, B and input carry Cin) and two outputs (Sum trit and output
    carry Cout). Normal Full Adder takes trits A, B and Cin, adds them together and sends their sum and carry to the
    outputs. Terilog tries to find the best (smaller amount of transistors) solution for the Full Adder and therefore
    uses the model of Full Adder with negated carries. It means that if trits A and B have normal values and Cin has
    inverted value (by STI), then Sum trit contains normal value and Cout trit contains inverted value. As in the case
    of Half Adder it is okay for arithmetic implementation, because carries should be inverted only twice (at max) even
    in the arbitrary big array of Full Adders.

    Here is the complete truth table for normal Full Adder. Note that Terilog offers only Full Adder with inverted carries.
