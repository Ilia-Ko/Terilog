<h1>Arithmetic</h1>
<p>
    Terilog is intended to design and simulate ternary CPUs, so arithmetic is essential, because every Turing-complete
    CPU has ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). Terilog offers the next arithmetical circuits: Half Adder, Full Adder. There is
    no special need in a Subtractor, because in ternary logic it is the same as Full Adder, but with one input number
    inverted (by STI inverter). Multiplier and Divider are going to be introduced in the future commits. There is a
    chance that one day Square Root Extractor will be build too. See underlying chapters for more info about arithmetic
    circuits.
