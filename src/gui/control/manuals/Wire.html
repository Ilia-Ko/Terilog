<h1>Adding a wire</h1>
<p>
    A wire is introduced into a circuit by pressing 'W' key. It can also be done by selecting a menu 'Wire', but this
    is not recommended - it causes difficulties while laying out the wire.
</p>
<p>
    After you pressed 'W' key a semi-transparent wire appears under the cursor. Its beginning will stay at the initial
    point while its end will follow the cursor. A wire is being laid out in a form of 'corner' - it is very convenient,
    because such a line can connect two arbitrary points of a circuit. If you press Space during layout - the corner is
    flipped. Escape key breaks wire insertion (as it breaks component insertion too). When the wire gets ready to be
    placed onto the grid - click the left button of the mouse.
</p>
<p>
    After layout is done, every wire line can be removed by right-clicking it and selecting 'Remove' in a context menu.
    Wires are removed line by line, not corner by corner. It means that removing a wire is twice harder than inserting it.
