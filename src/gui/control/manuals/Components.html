<h1>The world of Components</h1>
<p>
    Digital ternary ideal component library is a central part of Terilog. It contains such low-level subjects as
    transistors and diodes, logic-level items as inverters and gates, arithmetic-level elements such as adders. The
    variety of these inhabitant is going to grow in possible future releases. For example, ternary triggers, registers
    and counters will be introduced. The development will probably stop after a ternary CPU model can be simulated.

<p>
    The underlying chapters are going to describe every component and the difference between its ideal model and real
    hardware implementation.
