<h1>Step over</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: F8</h2>
<p>
    Step over does a lot of 'steps into' automatically in order to reach the final (stabilized) state of the circuit.
    Unfortunately, sometimes it is not possible (for example, an inverter with a direct feedback). In this case
    Terilog would got stuck in endless number of cyclic attempts, so there exists the 'maximal simulation depth' - the
    limiting number of allowed attempts. It is 50 by default and can be set from 'Settings' dialog (called by the
    'Settings' menu).
