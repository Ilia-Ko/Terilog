<h1>Grid</h1>
<p>
    Grid is very important and convenient invention of humanity, because it allows to rasterize a plane and deal with
    integers rather than real numbers.
</p>
<p>
    Terilog pointer (a red circle over the circuit) always snaps to grid in order to keep integer coordinates everywhere.
    Thus it is (luckily) impossible to insert a component or a wire somewhere between grid points. Moreover, all the
    transformations (rotating and mirroring) preserve the integrity of component coordinates. It is vital for parsing
    process before simulation that wire endings and components (actually, their pins) stayed strictly onto the grid points.
    Otherwise connections cannot be detected.
</p>
<p>
    The fundamental parameter of the grid is the distance between two neighbour points. It can be adjusted by zooming
    the grid in and out. Zooming can be done either by corresponding menus or by pressing keys <b>+</b>(=) and <b>-</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Other important parameters are grid width and size. They can be adjusted inside a 'Grid size' dialog (called by Ctrl+G
    key combination or corresponding menu). These values are measured in grid points and therefore must be natural integers.
    Current release of Terilog does not allow to set grid dimensions below 12 or above 144 grid points.
