<h1>Parse</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: F5</h2>
<p>
    Parsing the circuit means preparing it for simulation - it makes Terilog 'understand' the circuit. After parsing
    the app 'knows' who is connected to whom and can transfer signals from one component to another through wires. If
    you begin simulation without pressing 'Parse' at first, nothing bad happens, because Terilog will then do parsing
    on its own. Therefore, this menu is optional and almost useless (some nice graphical animation will be probably
    added in the future releases).
