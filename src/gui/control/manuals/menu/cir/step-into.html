<h1>Step into</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: F7</h2>
<p>
    Step into is the elementary part of simulation process. In fact, the whole simulation consists of 'steps into'.
    During this step signals spread from one component to another through wires, but no further than one wire long.
    It is similar to 'debugging' a circuit: you can see what happens and where it happens. Wires and pins are coloured
    according to the signal on them.
