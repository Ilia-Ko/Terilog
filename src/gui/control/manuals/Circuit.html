<h1>Simulation</h1>
<p>
    Circuit simulation is the most interesting part of Terilog. Before simulation started, Terilog does not
    'understand' your circuit at all. It 'sees' just few terrible bunches of wires and several components enmeshed
    among them. But there is a 'Parse' action which makes the app try to 'understand' the circuit and find out,
    who is connected with whom. After the circuit is parsed, the simulation can be done. Voltages invoke the circuit
    and their signals spread among the components. But you should not worry about parsing - it will be done automatically
    if you directly begin simulation by pressing 'Step into' or 'Step over'. See corresponding chapters for more info.
</p>
<h1>Signals</h1>
<p>
    Few words about signals. As Terilog is digital ternary simulator, you might have said that only three types of
    signals are enough. Even they are, in an ideal circuit, though. Of course, digital simulation implies that the
    circuit is ideal, but Terilog goes a little bit (no, trit :) further and offers two additional signals. Here is the
    brief description of all five possible signals.
</p>

<h2>Stable signals</h2>
<p>
    Stable (strong) signals are powerful and clear voltage levels, which occupy the whole wire once they enter it. If
    two or more of them clashes on the single wire, an error occur. In a real circuit such an error will cause fatal
    energy leakage and may even damage the circuit. Thus, be aware of mixing strong signals together and design your
    circuits in a way to avoid errors like that.
</p>

<h4>Positive voltage level</h4>
<table>
    <tr><td>Short name:</td><td>POS</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Standard name:</td><td>HIGH</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Boolean name:</td><td>TRUE</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Math equivalent:</td><td>+1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Digit:</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Voltage:</td><td>+1.5 Volts</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Zero voltage level</h4>
<table>
    <tr><td>Short name:</td><td>NIL</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Standard name:</td><td>MID</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Boolean name:</td><td>UNKNOWN</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Math equivalent:</td><td>0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Digit:</td><td>0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Voltage:</td><td>0.0 Volts</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Negative voltage level</h4>
<table>
    <tr><td>Short name:</td><td>NEG</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Standard name:</td><td>LOW</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Boolean name:</td><td>FALSE</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Math equivalent:</td><td>-1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Digit:</td><td>&#x03bb</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Voltage:</td><td>-1.5 Volts</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Unstable signals</h2>
<p>
    Unstable (weak) signals are uncertain and dirty voltage levels, which behave badly. They would be a real pain, but
    they remind us that ideal circuits exist only inside a simulator, whereas there is nothing ideal in hardware.
    Anyway, Reconciliator component exist in Terilog to deal with them.
</p>

<h4>No signal</h4>
<table>
    <tr><td>Short name:</td><td>Z</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Standard name:</td><td>ZZZ</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Boolean name:</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Math equivalent:</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Digit:</td><td>?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Voltage:</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>
ZZZ signal is initial signal of every wire and pin, because it means the absence of voltage. No voltage is applied to
a wire/pin and component cannot draw any current from it and therefore cannot 'read' a signal. That's why behaviour of
the component who received Z signal is undefined and many components will just produce an error on their output(s).

<h4>Error signal</h4>
<table>
    <tr><td>Short name:</td><td>E</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Standard name:</td><td>ERR</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Boolean name:</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Math equivalent:</td><td>1/0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Digit:</td><td>!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Voltage:</td><td>any</td></tr>
</table>
ERR signal appears when two or more strong signals clash on a single wire or when a component receives ZZZ signal.
This signal is fatal, a circuit is very likely to crash if ERR signal once appeared.
