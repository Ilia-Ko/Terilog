<h1>Settings</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: F2</h2>
In current release, there are only two settings of a circuit: its name and maximal simulation depth. The name is
completely clear and totally useless, whereas maximal simulation depth is absolutely essential for stable and reliable
simulation. First parameter is String, second is a natural integer. It is recommended to keep maximal simulation
depth between 10 and 100 unless you are running (not designing :) a super computer.
