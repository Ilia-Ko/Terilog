<h1>Reset</h1>
<h2>Shortcut: F5</h2>
<p>
    Make Terilog forget about connections in the circuit, erase all signals all over the wires and pins. As a result,
    app will 'see' your circuit as nice collection of wires and components disconnected from each other. This action is
    useful when you want to restart the simulation process.
