<h1>TERILOG</h1>
<p>
    Terilog is quite primitive digital simulator for simple ternary circuits with proto-HDL support. The latest means,
    that circuits can be described in XML files.

    Terilog offers three levels of abstraction for circuit design: transistors, gates and micro architecture. See chapters
    about components for more detailed description.

    What can you do with Terilog? Here is probable pattern of your usual activities:
    <ol>
        <li>Draw digital ternary circuits.</li>
        <li>Save these circuits as Terilog files (a kind of XML).</li>
        <li>Open arbitrary Terilog files.</li>
        <li>Simulate these circuits.</li>
    </ol>
