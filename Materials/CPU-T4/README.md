Here are some documents, related to the "T4" - 6-trit ternary RISC microprocessor

Image 'cpu-4-details.jpg' depicts structural parts of the CPU:
1) Instruction counter
2) RAM, 3^6 = 729 trytes available (6-trit machine words)
3) Instruction conveyor (variable instruction length 1, 2 or 3 trytes)
4) Registers (R1, R0, Rz - left to right)
5) ALU
6) Flags
7) Jump unit
8) Clock
9) Instruction decoder

File 'multiply.asm' is a simple programme for T4, written in ternary assembly. It multiplies two distinct trytes and leaves the result in CPU registers.
