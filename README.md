# Terilog
Digital simulator for low-level ternary circuits with basic HDL support.

The main usage of Terilog is:

1)  Constructing low-level digital ternary circuits from ideal transistors and logical primitives such as invertors, gates, arithmetics, memory cells, etc.
2)  Saving these circuits as HDL-like files (see '.TLG' file format below).
3)  Loading arbitrary TLG files.
4)  Simulating these circuits.
